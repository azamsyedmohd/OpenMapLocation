# ðŸš€OpenLayers React ProjectðŸ§¡

This project is a simple React application that uses the OpenLayers library to render a map and provides functionality to draw points, lines, and polygons on the map. Additionally, it calculates measurements such as area for polygons and length for lines.
## Features
- Render a map using OpenLayers.
- Allow users to locate a pinpoint on the map.
- Implement functionality to draw a polygon, point, and line on the map.
- Optionally calculate measurements (e.g., area for polygon, length for line).
- Implemented using React and OpenLayers.
## Usage
- Click on "Draw Point," "Draw Line," or "Draw Polygon" buttons to select the drawing type.
- Interact with the map to draw features.
- View area or length measurements after drawing.
